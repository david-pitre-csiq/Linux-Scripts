# ClamAV On-Access Scanner Installer

This repository contains an **all-in-one installer script** for setting up [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) with **real-time (on-access) scanning** on Ubuntu Linux.
Testing working on Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, and 25.04. Ensure you have at least 4GB of ram and ideally run an "apt update && apt full-upgrade -y" followed by a reboot before installing.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:**  
By default, the script enables on-access scanning for **the entire filesystem (`/`)**.  
This can be heavy on performance and I/O. In production, you may want to restrict it to user data directories (e.g. `/home`, `/var/www`).
